# Waiver & Free Agent System - Handoff Documentation

## Overview

This document provides a complete handoff of the waiver and free agent system built for the fantasy football Flutter app. The system allows users to browse available players, submit waiver claims with FAAB bidding, pick up free agents, view their claims, and track transaction history.

## What Was Built

### 1. Models

**Location:** `lib/models/`

#### `waiver_claim.dart`
- Represents a waiver claim with all necessary fields
- Properties: id, leagueId, rosterId, playerId, dropPlayerId, bidAmount, status, failureReason, createdAt, processedAt
- Helper getters: `isPending`, `isProcessed`, `isFailed`
- JSON serialization included

#### `transaction.dart`
- Represents completed transactions (waivers and free agents)
- Properties: id, leagueId, rosterId, transactionType, adds, drops, waiverBid, processedAt, username
- Helper getters: `isWaiver`, `isFreeAgent`, `typeDisplay`
- JSON serialization included

### 2. Service Layer

**Location:** `lib/services/waiver_service.dart`

Implements all API communication for waivers:
- `submitClaim()` - Submit a waiver claim with bid
- `getLeagueClaims()` - Get all claims for a league
- `getRosterClaims()` - Get claims for a specific roster
- `cancelClaim()` - Cancel a pending claim
- `pickupFreeAgent()` - Immediately add a free agent
- `getTransactions()` - Get transaction history

All methods include error handling and debug logging.

### 3. State Management

**Location:** `lib/providers/waiver_provider.dart`

Provider manages waiver state with methods:
- `loadClaims()` - Load user's claims
- `loadLeagueClaims()` - Load all league claims
- `submitClaim()` - Submit new waiver claim
- `cancelClaim()` - Cancel pending claim
- `pickupFreeAgent()` - Add free agent
- `loadTransactions()` - Load transaction history
- `pendingClaimsCount` getter for badge display

Status enum: `initial`, `loading`, `loaded`, `error`

### 4. UI Screens

#### `screens/waivers/waivers_hub_screen.dart`
**Main entry point for waiver system**
- Displays FAAB budget prominently
- Shows pending claims count badge
- Two main action buttons: "Browse Players" and "My Claims"
- Recent transactions list (last 10)
- Pull-to-refresh functionality

**Usage:**
```dart
Navigator.push(
  context,
  MaterialPageRoute(
    builder: (context) => WaiversHubScreen(
      leagueId: league.id,
      userRoster: userRoster,
    ),
  ),
);
```

#### `screens/players/available_players_screen.dart`
**Browse all available players**
- Search functionality (by name or team)
- Position filters (ALL, QB, RB, WR, TE, K, DEF)
- Shows FA/WAIVER badges
- Color-coded position indicators
- Tap player to show action sheet
- Automatically excludes rostered players

#### `screens/waivers/my_claims_screen.dart`
**View user's waiver claims**
- Lists all pending, processed, and failed claims
- Shows add/drop players with positions
- Displays bid amounts
- Status badges (pending/processed/failed)
- Cancel button for pending claims
- Failure reasons displayed
- Relative timestamps
- Pull-to-refresh

### 5. Widgets

#### `widgets/waiver/submit_claim_dialog.dart`
**Dialog for submitting claims or picking up free agents**
- Two modes: waiver claim or free agent pickup
- FAAB budget display (for waivers)
- Bid amount input with validation
- Drop player selector (optional)
- Loads user's roster for drop selection
- Form validation
- Loading states during submission
- Success/error feedback via SnackBar

**Usage:**
```dart
showDialog(
  context: context,
  builder: (context) => SubmitClaimDialog(
    leagueId: leagueId,
    userRoster: userRoster,
    player: player,
    isFreeAgent: false, // or true for free agents
  ),
);
```

#### `widgets/transaction/transaction_list.dart`
**Reusable transaction history widget**
- Can be embedded in any screen
- Shows transaction type badges
- Add/drop player details
- Waiver bid amounts
- Team names
- Relative timestamps
- Empty state handling
- Uses player cache for efficiency

**Usage:**
```dart
TransactionList(
  transactions: waiverProvider.transactions,
  token: authProvider.token,
)
```

### 6. Integration

**Modified:** `lib/main.dart`
- Added `WaiverProvider` to MultiProvider
- Import added: `import 'providers/waiver_provider.dart';`

## Navigation Flow

### Recommended Integration Points

1. **From League Details Screen:**
   Add a "Waivers" button/card that navigates to `WaiversHubScreen`

2. **From Roster Details Screen:**
   Add FAAB budget display and link to waivers

3. **From Home Screen:**
   Could add a global "Waivers" section (optional)

### Example Navigation Code

```dart
// In league details screen
ElevatedButton.icon(
  onPressed: () {
    // Get user's roster for this league
    final userRoster = rosters.firstWhere(
      (r) => r.userId == authProvider.user!.id,
    );

    Navigator.push(
      context,
      MaterialPageRoute(
        builder: (context) => WaiversHubScreen(
          leagueId: widget.leagueId,
          userRoster: userRoster,
        ),
      ),
    );
  },
  icon: const Icon(Icons.swap_horiz),
  label: const Text('Waivers'),
)
```

## Testing the Flow

### 1. Happy Path - Submit Waiver Claim

1. Navigate to league details screen
2. Click "Waivers" button (you need to add this)
3. See hub with FAAB budget
4. Click "Browse Players"
5. Use search or filters to find player
6. Tap player, tap "Submit Waiver Claim"
7. Enter bid amount, optionally select drop player
8. Submit
9. See success message
10. Navigate to "My Claims" to verify

### 2. Free Agent Pickup

1. Browse players
2. Find a free agent (FA badge)
3. Tap "Add Free Agent"
4. Optionally select drop player
5. Submit (no bid required)
6. See immediate success

### 3. Cancel Claim

1. Go to "My Claims"
2. See pending claims
3. Tap "Cancel Claim"
4. Confirm in dialog
5. Claim disappears from list

### 4. View Transaction History

1. From Waivers Hub, scroll down
2. See recent transactions
3. View adds/drops, bids, timestamps

## Backend API Endpoints Used

- `POST /api/leagues/:leagueId/waivers/claim` - Submit claim
- `GET /api/rosters/:rosterId/waivers/claims` - Get roster claims
- `DELETE /api/waivers/claims/:claimId` - Cancel claim
- `POST /api/leagues/:leagueId/transactions/free-agent` - Pickup FA
- `GET /api/leagues/:leagueId/transactions` - Get transaction history
- `GET /api/leagues/:leagueId` - Get league with rosters
- `GET /api/rosters/:rosterId/players` - Get roster players
- `GET /api/players` - Get all players
- `GET /api/players/:playerId` - Get player by ID

## What's Working

- ✅ Browse all available players
- ✅ Search and filter players
- ✅ Submit waiver claims with FAAB bids
- ✅ Validation: bid amount <= budget
- ✅ Optional drop player selection
- ✅ Pick up free agents immediately
- ✅ View all user's claims (pending/processed/failed)
- ✅ Cancel pending claims
- ✅ View transaction history
- ✅ FAAB budget display
- ✅ Pending claims count badge
- ✅ Error handling and loading states
- ✅ Pull-to-refresh on lists

## What's Missing / TODO

### High Priority

1. **Navigation Button** - Add waiver access from league details screen
2. **Roster Badge** - Show pending claims count on roster screen
3. **Real Waiver Status** - Backend needs to determine if player is on waivers vs free agent based on drop time
4. **Player Stats** - Available players screen could show player stats/projections

### Medium Priority

5. **Socket Updates** - Real-time updates when claims process (Agent 3 will add)
6. **Waiver Order** - Display waiver priority order in league
7. **Claim Priority** - Allow reordering multiple claims
8. **Transaction Filters** - Filter by type, date range, team

### Low Priority

9. **Player Details** - Tap player to see full stats before claiming
10. **Notifications** - Push notifications when claims process
11. **Pagination** - For players list and transaction history
12. **Bulk Actions** - Drop multiple players at once

## Known Limitations

1. **Player Waiver Status:** Currently hardcoded to show all available players as free agents. Backend needs to track when players are dropped and enforce waiver period.

2. **FAAB Budget:** Assumed to be stored in `roster.settings.faab_budget`. Backend agent needs to ensure this field exists.

3. **Player Endpoint:** Uses `GET /api/players` to fetch all players. This might need pagination for large datasets.

4. **No Real-time Updates:** Changes require manual refresh. Socket updates will be added by Agent 3.

5. **Error Messages:** Generic error messages. Could be more specific based on backend error codes.

## Dependencies

All dependencies were already present in the project:
- `provider` - State management
- `http` - API calls
- Flutter Material Design

## Color Scheme

Following the app's existing design:
- Primary: Dark Blue (#1E3A8A)
- Secondary: Bright Orange (#FF6B35)
- Tertiary: Bright Teal (#00D9FF)
- Waiver Badge: Orange
- Free Agent Badge: Green
- Add Action: Green
- Drop Action: Red

## Next Steps for Integration

1. **Add Navigation:** In `league_details_screen.dart`, add a button/card to navigate to `WaiversHubScreen`

2. **Test with Backend:** Ensure backend API matches expected request/response format

3. **Add to Roster Screen:** Show FAAB budget and pending claims on roster details

4. **Polish UI:** Add animations, improve empty states, add loading skeletons

5. **Handle Edge Cases:** Roster full, insufficient budget, player already claimed

## Questions for Backend Agent

- Is FAAB budget stored in `roster.settings.faab_budget`?
- How does backend determine if player is on waivers vs free agent?
- What error codes should we handle?
- Are there any rate limits on the player list endpoint?
